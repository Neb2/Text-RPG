Text RPG
=

A text RPG developed in Python 3.

As my first big project, the aim of this project is to be a learning experience, 
and as so I'm sure there's a lot of badly written code. This is also why certain 
features in the game such as the weapon/armour equip and potion systems work differently, 
as it was more of attempting to see the different ways to code rather than the best way.
